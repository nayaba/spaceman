# Spaceman - The Galactic Hangman Game

Welcome to Spaceman, a twist on the classic hangman game set in the vast expanse of space! This game is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring you an interstellar word-guessing adventure. Get ready to save your astronaut from getting lost in space by guessing the right words!

## Game Description

In Spaceman, your mission is to guess the hidden word before your astronaut runs out of oxygen. Each incorrect guess brings your spaceman closer to being lost in the cosmos. Correct guesses, on the other hand, will reveal letters of the mysterious word and bring your astronaut closer to safety.

- **Dynamic Word Bank**: A vast collection of words that makes every game a new adventure.
- **Attempts Counter**: Keep track of your remaining guesses as you try to save your spaceman.
- **Letter Guessing**: Click or type to guess letters in the word.
- **Win/Lose Notifications**: Instant feedback on your game status with engaging animations.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Load the game in your browser to start your space adventure.
2. **Guess Letters**: Click on the alphabet on your screen or use your keyboard to guess letters.
3. **Watch Your Steps**: Each wrong guess will deplete your astronaut's oxygen level.
